In 2003, the Parliament changed the law to allow for a man to be registered as the father of a child resulting from a fertility treatment undertaken after the man's death.

As a result the deceased man's name, surname, occupation and place of birth can be entered in the birth register and birth certificate. To register the infant's father the mother needs the man's written consent to the fertility treatment and to being named the legal parent.

Other required documents include:

- Written confirmation from the clinic that the man's consent had not been withdrawn
- The mother's written request for the man to be named as the father in the birth registration
- Written confirmation of the fertility treatment from the treatment clinic or hospital doctor 
- The father's original death certificate
- The couple's original marriage certificate where applicable

If an unmarried father dies before the child is born, there are several steps to be taken for his name to be registered on the birth certificate. The process is lengthy and significantly costly.

A lawyer is not compulsory to complete the form. But due to its complexity it might be easier to seek legal help.

First there needs to be a DNA test to prove the biological relation between the child and the deceased parent. It costs approximately Â£200.
