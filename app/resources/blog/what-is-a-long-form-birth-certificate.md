**What is a long form birth certificate?**

There are two versions of your [birth certificate](https://www.simplycertificate.co.uk/replacement-birth-certificate) available in Britain, a long and short form.

A birth certificate works as evidence of a person's name, date and place of birth. This type of documentation is required as personal identification, such as passport applications, proving eligibility for one, and for marriage purposes.

Every child receives a copy of their short form birth certificate when their parent or guardian registers them with the government after birth. While this is enough for most situations in life, there are times when a long form certificate is needed.

**Short form birth certificate**

The short-form birth certificate provides the minimum information required to verify the individual's date of birth and british nationality. When applying for a child's first passport, a birth certificate is one of the simplest ways to [prove eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/british-passport-eligibility).
